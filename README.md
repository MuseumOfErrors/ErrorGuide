# Museum of Errors Site

Museumoferrors.com is an open-source site collecting data on Pokemon error cards so new collectors have a good starting place, non-error collectors to learn more about their finds, and experienced collectors to share their information and resources with the community.

## Setup

1. Install Jekyll and Bundler:
   ```sh
   gem install jekyll bundler
